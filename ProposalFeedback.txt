Proposal Document [2 points]:
Your Verbal Description and Justification are complete, well-written, and
aligned with typical expectations for CMSI 4072.
   What you already do well
      Clear explanation of functionality
      Good articulation of user workflow

      Realistic scoping
      Well-organized writing

   What can make it even stronger

      More clearly differentiate your tool from existing schedulers
      Tie the Justification more tightly to software engineering learning
         goals
      Call out specific engineering challenges and AI contributions

Proposal Presentation [Slides and video] [3 points]:
Your slides:
   Match the description nicely and completely
   Nicely laid out, good use of graphics
   Slide 4 is a bit wordy, but does cover what you want to say


Summary:
--------
Conclusion: The Verbal Description is complete, well-structured, and easy
               to understand.
            The Justification section is also complete, well-reasoned, and
               appropriate for CMSI 4072.

Nice job overall!  Keep up the good work.  Will update after your video is
posted.

VIDEO EVALUATION
================
Well done!  I think this will be a very useful application.
Your presentation was well done, with an even mix of everyone taking part.
You were clear in presenting your proposed application with reasoning and
motivation.  One thing to consider for next time, do a volume check on
everyone's voice to make sure they are all at the same level, and turn up
the microphones of those that are softer.  Chris was a little softer than
the others and there were places where it was hard to hear him.

Other than that, excellent work!
