=======================================

COMPONENT BREAKDOWN:
   Strengths:
      What’s present (evidence):
         The Introduction notes a web-based system with a back-end component
            to process availability and a database to store events/responses
            but no further decomposition or inter-component interfaces are
            described
         Why this is incomplete per the course guidance:
            For completeness, the class emphasizes understandability of what
               the software must do and who/what is involved, typically
               supported by structural views (diagrams) so stakeholders can
               see boundaries and interactions.  A succinct component
               breakdown (context + components + interfaces) is expected
               for clarity
   Suggestions:
      Add a System Context Diagram identifying external actors (Organizer,
         Participants, Email/SMS provider, Calendar APIs, Auth provider,
         Analytics, etc.) and system boundaries
      Provide a Component Diagram with concise descriptions of:
         Web UI (event creation, availability UI, results views),
         Scheduling/Availability Service (aggregation, conflict resolution,
            tie-breaking),
         Notification Service (email/SMS invites/confirmations),
         Persistence Layer (events, slots, responses, audit),
         Auth/Identity (if applicable),
         Integration Adapters (e.g., Google/Microsoft calendar sync)
      For each component, list responsibilities, key inputs/outputs, and
         interfaces (REST endpoints, events, DB tables).  This aligns with
            the class expectation of clear, complete descriptions aided by
            diagrams

FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS:
   Strengths:
      Four functional clusters exist with “shall” statements
         Meeting Creation (create event, specify candidate date/times,
            unique link)
         Availability Submission (open link, select times, store
            availability)
         Availability Processing (aggregate availability, derive options,
            present to organizer)..pdf)
         Event Finalization (close submissions, choose final time, share
            final time)
   Suggestions:
      Add role definitions and permission requirements (Organizer vs.
         Participant; anonymous vs. authenticated).
      Specify invitation flows (collect emails/phone numbers, send invites,
         reminder cadence, opt-out) and finalization notifications.
      Define time-zone handling explicitly (user-local capture, canonical
         storage, display rules), tie-breaking algorithms (maximize count,
         minimize dissent), and quorum rules.
      Add error handling and validation (expired links, duplicate
         names/emails, invalid time ranges, server timeouts/retries)


PERFORMANCE REQUIREMENTS:
   Strengths:
      Why this is incomplete: Completeness around “how well it must work”
         calls for quantified, testable targets tied to realistic conditions
         (device/browser/network).  Vague phrases are not sufficient for
         verification/validation
   Suggestions:
      Response time: “Record availability submission and render updated
         tallies = 500 ms p95 on a mid-range laptop (Chrome stable) over
         10 Mbps network; server processing = 200 ms p95.”
      Result computation: “Generate ranked candidate times for
         N participants × M slots in = 1.0 s p95 for N=100, M=20.”
      Scalability (capacity): “Support events up to 200 participants and
         50 candidate slots without degradation beyond 1.5 s p95 for results
         calculation.”
      Availability/robustness: “Degrade gracefully on packet loss up to 2%;
         queue submissions and retry for up to 30 s.”
      These kinds of metrics make the spec verifiable and align with the
         “how well” dimension of completeness

ENVIRONMENT REQUIREMENTS:
   Strengths:
      Why this is incomplete per the guidance:
      Completeness typically includes browser/OS versions, runtime stack,
         network assumptions, storage, and any service dependencies so
         developers/testers/users know the supported environment with enough
         specificity
   Suggestions:
      Client support: List minimum browser versions (e.g., Chrome/Edge = 100,
         Firefox = 100, Safari = 15) and mobile/tablet posture (supported/not
         supported).
            DB engine/version), deployment model (PaaS/IaaS), and time-zone
            policy (UTC storage).
      Network: Minimum bandwidth/latency assumptions for the stated
         performance targets (e.g., 10 Mbps down/2 Mbps up)
      Storage & backup: Data size expectations per event, retention/backups,
         and export formats

   Total Percentage:   5.0/10 = 50.0% on this deliverable


OVERALL ASSESSMENT:
   Components are briefly mentioned (web app + backend + DB) but there’s no
      explicit breakdown or diagram describing responsibilities and
      interfaces.
   Core flow (create event, collect availability, compute options, finalize)
      is covered with “shall” statements, but many expected user behaviors,
      edge cases, and roles are missing
   Only vague targets (“without noticeable delay,” “reasonable time”) and
      a generic capacity statement; lacks measurable, testable metrics
   Lists basic dev items (IDE, GitHub, browser) and generic execution needs
      (Internet, server), but omits browser/OS versions, storage, security,
      and network characteristics


NOt a bad start... I encourage you to make the indicated additions by the
end of the semester for full credit on this deliverable.  Let me know if
you need some suggestions!  I'm here to help you.
